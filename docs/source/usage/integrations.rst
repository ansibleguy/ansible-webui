ARA Records Ansible
*******************

ARA can be used to gather detailed statistics of Ansible executions.

To enable AW to send data to an ARA server - you need to:

* Install the :code:`ara` Python3 module on your controller system
* Configure the server at `System - Config`

Quote: ara provides Ansible reporting by recording ansible and ansible-playbook commands regardless of how and where they run.
